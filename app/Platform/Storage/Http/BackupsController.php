/**
 * The archives kept on a storage target.

 * Which target is a per-request decision: `file_disk_id` selects one, and
 * without it the backup purpose setting decides, falling back to the default
 * disk. Every action re-resolves it, so a caller may list one disk and delete
 * from another in the same session.
 *
 * An archive is addressed by its path on that disk, and a path is only ever
 * accepted if it names a zip -- the one thing standing between these endpoints
 * and an arbitrary file on the storage target.
